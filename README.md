**CISE Sim** is an application capable of sending and receiving CISE messages to/from CISE Nodes, adaptors or other CISE Sims. The CISE Sim is conformant to the CISE Service model.

## Functionalities
- send CISE messages using a template 
- receive CISE messages
- validate the CISE messages according to the CISE Data and Service models.
- store sent/received messages
- display the message history and the message threads (messages chains) 
- discover CISE services from a CISE Node 


## Endpoints
The CISE Sim exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint|Description 
|---|---
|``http://HOST_ADDRESS:8200/``| Web interface (for web browsers) 
|``http://HOST_ADDRESS:8200/api/messages`` | REST interface (to **receive** CISE messages from other adaptors/nodes/CISE Sim)
|``http://HOST_ADDRESS:8200/api/soap/messages``| SOAP interface (to **receive** CISE messages from other adaptors/nodes/CISE Sim)

>
> The CISE Sim can receive CISE messages from the REST and the SOAP endpoints at the same time.
>
> To change the default port (```8200```), please check the `config.yml` file.
>

# Installation

## Requirements
- GNU/Linux operative system
- Java 8 or Java 11
- Docker version 19 at least (optional)

## Software Packages

The CISE Sim is packaged and disbributed as:
- a tar.gz archive: cise-sim-``VERSION``.tar.gz
- a Docker container

## TAR.gz Archive 

Untar the cise-sim-``VERSION``.tar.gz in a folder:

```bash
$ mkdir -p /my/installation/path 
$ tar -xvzf cise-sim-VERSION.tar.gz -C /my/installation/path --strip-components=1
```

Set up `$PATH` and `$JAVA_HOME` variables
```bash
$ export PATH=/path/to/java/bin:$PATH
$ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
```

## Docker container
To use docker image, the following version of docker and docker-compose are needed:  

**docker version 19 at least**  
**docker-compose version 1.25 at least**  

The name of the docker image is 

**ec-jrc/cise-sim:latest**

### Install the docker image 
To install the docker image in the local docker images repository, use the following command:
```
docker load < docker_cisesim_1.3.2.tar.gz
```

### Set up Docker volumes

Create in the host the following folders in any location
(e.g., under /my/installation/path):

| Folder | Folder in Docker | Description

```bash
$ mkdir -p /my/installation/path/conf
$ mkdir -p /my/installation/path/logs
$ mkdir -p /my/installation/path/msghistory
```

 


# Set up the CISE Sim

```

## Configuration files

The ``conf/`` folder contains three configuration files:

- ``sim.properties``
- ``config.yml``
- Java Key Store (JKS) for message signature.

### sim.properties

This file contains the parameters to set up the protocol, the endpoint and the message signature.

### config.yml

The CISE Sim uses Dropwizard as application server. The file ``config.yml`` defines the parameters for the application server. For additional information on this file, please check the [Dropwizard manual](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/manual/configuration.html).

```yaml
server:
  # Protocol and port of simulator web interface
  applicationConnectors:
    - type: http
      port: 8200
``` 

While the logging information can be found mostly under the ``logging.loggers`` configuration:
```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
  loggers:
    "io.dropwizard.bundles.assets": INFO
    "eu.cise.sim.api": INFO

### Java Key Store

The CISE Sim is distributed with a sample Java Key Store file. 

To connect the CISE Sim to a CISE Node, the node administrator should create a specific participant for the CISE Sim. The node administrator must provide the JKS file for the participant with the parameters to access the certificates.

> The new JKS file **must** be stored under the ``conf`` folder.


# Launch the CISE Sim
- When launching the scripts below (sim start | run) prompts will appear to the user to enter the:
   - keystore password
   - the private key password 

## As a process 

### Start in foreground
To run the application in a foreground process:

```bash
$ cd /my/installation/path
$ ./sim run
```

The application log will be displayed in the standard output.
The CISE Sim will ``stop`` if the terminal session is closed.

### Start in background
To run the application in a background process:

```bash
$ cd /my/installation/path
$ ./sim start
```

Output:
```bash
== CISE sim =====================================
Java path:    /usr/bin/java
Java version: "11.0.7"
=================================================
[ok] sim started at 2020-07-07T17:09:53+02:00
```

With the start command, the CISE Sim will run in background (using nohup) even if the terminal session is closed.   

The application log will be stored in the file ``logs/sim.log``:

```bash
$ cd /my/installation/path
$ tail -f logs/sim.log
```

### Stop a CISE Sim in background
To stop a CISE Sim launched in background:

```bash
$ cd /my/installation/path
$ ./sim stop
```

Output:

```bash
[ok] sim has been stopped
```

### Other commands 
 
```bash
$ cd /my/installation/path
$ ./sim
Usage: sim COMMAND
sim server lifecycle manager (starting, stopping, debugging).
COMMAND
    start       starts the simulator in a detached shell using nohup command.
    run         starts the simulator in foreground.
    stop        stops the simulator running in background.
    restart     restart the simulator running in background.
    debug-start starts the simulator in a detached shell launching the application
                in debug mode (port 9999).
    debug-run   starts the simulator in foreground launching the application
                in debug mode (port 9999).
    status      show the current status the simulator (started or stopped).
    send        send a message from an xml file
```

#### Sending a message from command line
With the command ./sim send-msg 'filename' is possible to send a message contained in a xml file.
The destination is the same configured for cise-sim and message sent and ack received will be stored in the cise-sim repository directory


## As a Docker container
To create and run the container we suggest using a simple docker compose file, where map the server ports and the volumes. For example :  
```
version: '3'
services:
  cise-sim:
    image: jrc-ispra/cise-sim:latest
    volumes:
      - /my/installation/path/conf:/srv/cise-simulator/conf
      - /my/installation/path/logs:/srv/cise-simulator/logs
      - /my/installation/path/msghistory:/srv/cise-simulator/msghistory
    ports:
      - 8280:8200
      - 8201:8201
``` 

To startup the docker container, open a terminal in the same directory where compose file is and execute the docker compose command :
```
docker-compose up -d
```
You can use the one provided with the distribution, but remember to modify the **/my/installation/path/** with the path used in the host machine

# Message History

Sent/Received CISE messages are stored in the `msghistory` folder by default. 

Each message is stored in a single XML file, whose filename follows this pattern:  
```
Timestamp_TypeName_Direction_Uuid
```

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
|Timestamp|Timestamp when the message was processed,following the format : yyyyMMdd-HHmmssSSS
|TypeName|Type of the message (i.e. PULLREQUEST, FORWARD, etc.) For the Acknowledge messages, SYNC are the ones received/sent synchronously after the message was sent/received
|Direction|RECV for message received, or SENT for message sent
|Uuid|Unique identifier (UUID)

Examples:  
`20200611-120029798_PULLREQUEST_SENT_31fb100d-dd13-450d-858b-d410a5f2c345`

`20200611-120029808_ACKSYNCH_RECV_184e0b37-bdb0-4efd-b993-ac18abd1f7ec`
